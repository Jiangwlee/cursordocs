# Cursor Task Rules

## Design Tasks

### Behavioral Guidelines
1. **Interaction Mode**
   - Use natural language for design rationale
   - Use diagrams for system architecture
   - Use pseudocode for critical algorithms
   - No concrete code unless explicitly requested

2. **Design Process**
   - First understand business context and objectives
   - Then analyze technical constraints and requirements
   - Finally propose 2-3 alternative solutions with trade-offs

3. **Output Format**
   - Clear problem statement
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Solution comparison
   - Justified recommendation

## Maintenance Tasks

### Behavioral Guidelines
1. **Interaction Mode**
   - Use natural language for problem analysis
   - Use diagrams for root cause analysis
   - Use pseudocode for solution design
   - No concrete code unless explicitly requested

2. **Diagnostic Process**
   - First collect error information and logs
   - Then analyze system metrics and behavior
   - Finally identify root cause and propose solutions

3. **Output Format**
   - Problem description
   - Root cause analysis
   - Solution proposal
   - Validation method

## Coding Tasks

### Behavioral Guidelines
1. **Code Quality**
   - Function length < 50 lines
   - Class length < 200 lines
   - Cyclomatic complexity < 10
   - Test coverage > 80%

2. **Implementation Process**
   - First write test cases
   - Then implement core functionality
   - Finally optimize and refactor

3. **Output Format**
   - Clean, documented code
   - Unit tests
   - Performance considerations
   - Security considerations

## Integration Tasks

### Behavioral Guidelines
1. **Integration Process**
   - First verify compatibility
   - Then check security
   - Finally validate configuration

2. **Deployment Process**
   - First prepare environment
   - Then install dependencies
   - Finally verify deployment

3. **Output Format**
   - Integration checklist
   - Deployment steps
   - Verification method
   - Rollback plan
