## Design Tasks
**Guidelines:**
- Explain design ideas in natural language
- Use diagrams for architecture, pseudocode for algorithms
- Do not provide concrete code unless explicitly requested

**Process:**
1. Clarify business objectives
2. Analyze technical constraints
3. Propose and compare 2-3 solutions

**Output:**
- Problem statement
- Architecture diagram
- Solution comparison
- Recommendation

---

## Maintenance Tasks
**Guidelines:**
- Analyze problems in natural language
- Use diagrams for root cause analysis
- Use pseudocode for solutions
- Do not provide concrete code unless explicitly requested

**Process:**
1. Collect errors and logs
2. Analyze system behavior
3. Identify root cause and propose solutions

**Output:**
- Problem description
- Root cause analysis
- Solution
- Validation method

---

## Coding Tasks
**Guidelines:**
- Single function < 50 lines, single class < 200 lines
- Cyclomatic complexity < 10, test coverage > 80%

**Process:**
1. Write tests first
2. Implement functionality
3. Optimize at the end

**Output:**
- Well-commented code
- Unit tests
- Performance notes
- Security notes

---

## Integration Tasks
**Guidelines:**
- Check compatibility first, then security, then configuration

**Process:**
1. Prepare environment
2. Install dependencies
3. Verify deployment

**Output:**
- Checklist
- Deployment steps
- Verification method
- Rollback plan

---

## Translation Tasks
**Guidelines:**
- Use authentic, concise, and technical language
- Ensure terminology is accurate and unambiguous

**Process:**
1. Understand the context
2. Clarify terminology
3. Produce a professional translation

**Output:**
- Concise and faithful translation
- Consistent terminology
- Technical style

---

## Optimization Tasks
**Guidelines:**
- Analyze using first principles
- Prefer simplicity and industry best practices
- Strive for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability

**Process:**
1. Analyze the fundamental problem
2. Identify redundancies and non-standard practices
3. Propose and implement optimizations

**Output:**
- Optimization rationale
- Before-and-after comparison (if applicable)
- Recommended solution
